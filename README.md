ðŸŒŒ Asteroid Soundscape

A data-art experiment: transforming NASA Near-Earth Object (NEO) data into sound and visuals.


ðŸš€ Project Overview

This project explores the intersection of astronomy, sound, and generative art.
It consists of two parts:

**Interactive Web Visualizer (React + Three.js)**

  Fetches real asteroid flyby data from NASAâ€™s NEO API.

  Displays asteroids orbiting around Earth in 3D.

  Responds in real time to audio (MP3, MIDI).

  Hazardous asteroids glow red, while safe ones appear blue-white.

  Pulses and color shifts sync with audio amplitude or MIDI note events.

**Python Sonification Tool (MIDI Generator)**

  Converts raw asteroid data into a MIDI composition.

  Maps parameters like miss distance â†’ note velocity and velocity â†’ note duration.
  
  Hazardous asteroids trigger drum hits.

  Outputs multitrack MIDI that can be loaded into a DAW (Ableton, Logic, FL, etc.) for mixing/exporting.

**Together, these create a sonic & visual soundscape of asteroid flybys.**
